deploying an Azure Landing zone using modules 

1 - create a SPN with subscription scope

2 - copy the SPN's details in the variable.tf file. 

3 - (optional ) there is no Tfvars file so far for automation. It will come in next setup. 


NOTE : for themanagement groups, you might need the SPN name as Management group contributor to delete them for clean up
